# data
The data that I am presenting are the math scores of New York City students with and without a disability from grades 3 - 8 between the year 2006 and 2012.

Some questions I hope to answer by analizing this data is :
1. Do students with disabilties struggle more with math compared to students who do not have a disability?
2. Do students who succeed in math continue to do so as they progress?
3. Are scores consistent throughout the grade levels?
4. Are scores consistent throughtout the year?
